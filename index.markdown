# Enforcing, Inferring, and Synthesizing Optional Properties (EISOP) Framework

The Enforcing, Inferring, and Synthesizing Optional Properties (EISOP) Framework project
aims to provide a unified framework for optional properties in Java.

Development occurs in the
[Checker Framework eisop fork](https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework).
The focus in this fork is on soundness and usability.
One (closed-source) user of the EISOP Dataflow Framework reported a 10 percent
reduction in false positives compared to the typetools Dataflow Framework.

Releases can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework/releases) and
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.dev/namespace/io.github.eisop).

More research results can be found on a
[separate page](https://opprop.github.io/).

The [javac diagnostics wrapper](https://github.com/eisopux/javac-diagnostics-wrapper)
is a wrapper around javac to output diagnostics in an easily-configurable way.
